# Inflation-in-Reserve

This repository is a collection of the data sources and code files used to investigate the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) as an economic bailout tool during the post-Covid recovery. The timing of the Federal Reserve's target interest rate increase came right before the insuing oil and gas price increases resultant of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Given the sensitivity of the Fed during this recovery period and the inverse relationship of SPR releases during backwardated markets, which the oil market was in, it is plausible that the release of the SPR was intended as a consumer sentiment supplement to keep a positive outlook for the Fed during a time of high-stress monetary policy.

This repository will record keep the iterative process of working through the data and modeling phase with some version control involving the literature review.
